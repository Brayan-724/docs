```diff
routes
| sub-route
| | _index.ts
| | _middleware.ts
| | _fallback.ts
| | _ignored.ts
| | sub-sub-route.ts
| _index.ts
| _middleware.ts
| _fallback.ts
| _ignored.ts
```

## Conventions and rules

### `_index.ts`
This will take the parent route and set itself as leaf.

The following tree will create a conflict at the router resolve:

```diff
  routes
  | sub
- | | _index.ts
- | sub.ts
```

`/sub/_index.ts` and `/sub.ts` are the same `/sub`.

### `_middleware.ts`
This will make a middleware in the route context.

```diff
  routes
  | sub
  | | route.ts
  | _index.ts
+ | _middleware.ts
```

When the user enter on `/sub/route` or `/`, the middleware on the root will be activated.

### `_fallback.ts`
This will set a fallback in the route context.

```diff
  routes
  | sub
  | | route.ts
+ | | _fallback.ts
  | _index.ts
+ | _fallback.ts
```

If the user enters on any non-handled route over `/sub` (`/sub/testing`) will be handled by `/sub/_fallback.ts`, but any other will be handled by `/_fallback.ts`.

### `_*.ts`
Any file that start with `_` and isn't a convention will be ignored.

```diff
  routes
  | sub
- | | _route.ts
- | | _ignored.ts
  | _index.ts
```

There is just one endpoint, the root index `/`, because `/sub/_ignored` and `/sub/_route` are ignored.
